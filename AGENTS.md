<general_rules>
  When creating new functions, always first search in existing directories to see if a similar function exists. If not, create it and place it in an existing or new file that logically groups related functionalities.
  Ensure all code adheres to the project's coding standards. While no specific linter or formatter scripts are explicitly defined, maintain consistency with existing code styles.
</general_rules>
<repository_structure>
  The repository is structured with a `README.md` file at its root, providing a general overview. Further details on specific modules or applications are not explicitly defined, suggesting a relatively flat or small project structure.
</repository_structure>
<dependencies_and_installation>
  Specific instructions for dependency installation and package managers are not explicitly provided. It is assumed that standard Python dependency management practices (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` if a `requirements.txt` file were present, or direct `pip install` for individual packages) would apply.
</dependencies_and_installation>
<testing_instructions>
  No specific testing framework or instructions are explicitly defined within the repository. Developers should aim to write unit tests for new functionalities and ensure existing functionalities are not broken by changes. Standard Python testing practices (e.g., `unittest` or `pytest` if installed) are recommended.
